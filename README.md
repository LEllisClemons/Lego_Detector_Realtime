# Lego_Detector_Realtime

This repo is a productionalized version of a model trained from a modified version of this kaggle notebook https://www.kaggle.com/code/databeru/classify-bricks-compare-transfer-learning-model/notebook by DataLira (https://www.kaggle.com/databeru). The code used to train the model and save the video can be found in lego_detect_training.py in the model_building folder.

This application, started by running main.py, will simulate making predictions on 'real time' camera footage by utilizing multiprocessing and OpenCV.

The structure of the application is below:
